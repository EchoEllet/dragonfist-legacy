- Knights and Bandits will now remember their home.
- Bandits that are spawned in a structure will get back to their base if they get far away.
    - They will stroll randomly now inside the structure.
- Adapted the Minecraft `MobSpawnType` -> `EntitySpawnReason` rename in `1.21.11`, for an easier port later.
- **Breaking Change:** Renamed some NBT keys to be more future-proof. This has minimal gameplay impact in existing
  worlds, and is mainly for custom data of the mod entities.

Stay tuned for more future updates!
