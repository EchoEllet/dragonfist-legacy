# DragonFist Legacy

Adds martial artists to Epic Fight, along with new content, structures, and mini-bosses throughout the world.

> **WIP:** The mod is currently in an early stage, as we plan to add more content, structures, enhanced AI, combat
> mechanics, animations, movesets, enhanced interactions, and more unique bosses.
> However, it's playable for now.

## Dependencies

- [Kotlin for Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/kotlin-for-forge) (**required**)
- [Epic Fight](https://modrinth.com/mod/epic-fight) (**optional**)
- [Epic Fight: Skill Tree](https://modrinth.com/mod/epic-fight-skill-tree) (**optional**)

## Fabric Support

Coming soon! For now, you can build it from
source [branch](https://github.com/EchoEllet/dragonfist-legacy/tree/feat/multi-platform-architecture). However,
the attack animations and models will be vanillified, as Epic Fight does not support Fabric yet.
