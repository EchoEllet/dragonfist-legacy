# DragonFist Legacy

Adds martial artists to Epic Fight, along with new content, structures, and mini-bosses throughout the world.

> **WIP:** The mod is currently in an **early stage** and is **incomplete**,
> as we plan to add more content, epic structures, enhanced AI, combat
> mechanics, animations, movesets, enhanced interactions, blocking and more unique bosses, items or entities.
> However, it's **playable** for now.
